Creates 128x128 colored PNGs for easy to add solid background in macOS

The playground will create PNGs under your Documents folder. You will need to create a folder named x128 under your Documents folder.

After you run the program, you should see 128x128 PNGs under the x128 folder.

You can move these and create more and name them inside the playground.

To use these under the Solid Colors option in the Desktop & Screen Saver, copy all the images wanted and move it to /Library/Desktop Pictures/Solid Colors/
